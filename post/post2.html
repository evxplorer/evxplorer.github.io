	<p>Transport is a fundamental requirement of modern life, but the traditional combustion engine is becoming
		outdated. Petrol or diesel vehicles are highly polluting and are being quickly replaced by fully electric
		vehicles (EV)s. EVs have zero tailpipe emissions and are much better for the environment. Apart from that, the
		running cost of an electric vehicle is much lower than an equivalent petrol or diesel vehicle. EVs also have
		very low maintenance costs because they donâ€™t have as many moving parts as compared to an internal combustion
		vehicle. Currently switching to greener alternatives for transportation is the need of the time. So central and
		state governments are incentivising EV transport. Because of that, registration fees and road tax on purchasing
		electric vehicles are lesser than petrol or diesel vehicles.</p>
