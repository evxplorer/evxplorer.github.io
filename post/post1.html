	<p>The Indian automobile industry is currently the fifth largest in the world, and by 2030, it's expected to
		overtake the United States as the largest. The Indian EV market would grow at a 36% CAGR, according to IESA
		(India Energy Storage Alliance). India imports more than 80% of its crude oil, making reliance on conventional
		energy sources unfeasible as the country's population grows and the demand for automobiles rises. By 2030, NITI
		Aayog anticipates that all commercial vehicles will have an EV market penetration of 70%, as well as 30% for
		private cars, 40% for buses, and 80% for two- and three-wheelers. To achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070,
		this is consistent. According to forecasts, the Indian electric car industry would increase from its 2021 value
		of USD 1,434.04 million to USD 15,397.19 million by 2025.

		With 66,704 units sold across all categories in 2021, Uttar Pradesh had the highest percentage of EV sales in
		India, followed by Karnataka with 33,302 units and Tamil Nadu with 30,036 units. Three-wheelers were dominated
		by Uttar Pradesh, while two-wheelers and four-wheelers were led by Karnataka and Maharashtra, respectively. By
		2030, carbon emissions will be reduced by 37% thanks to the Indian government's planned switch to electric
		vehicles.
